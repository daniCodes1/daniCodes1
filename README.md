### Welcome! 
I'm Dani, a third year computer science student at UBC. 

Some things I have been working on:
  * a [personal website](https://daniCodes1.github.io), which will help you get to know me better :smiley:
  * an application that reads and analyzes forms for a company (still a private repository, uses Python and JavaScript)
  * an [intelligent dashboard]([https://github.com/daniCodes1/IntelligentDashboard/tree/templateBranch](https://github.com/daniCodes1/IntelligentDashboard)) to support your daily tasks

Want to reach out? I'm available by [email](mailto:danirenn16@gmail.com) ðŸ«¶
