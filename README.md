### Welcome! ðŸ‘‹ 
I'm Dani, a third year computer science student at UBC. 

I'm currently working on:
  * a [personal website](https://daniCodes1.github.io), which will help you get to know me better :smiley:
  * an application that reads and analyzes forms for a company (still a private repository, uses Python and JavaScript)

Want to reach out? I'm available by [email](mailto:danirenn16@gmail.com) ðŸ«¶
