### Welcome! 
I’m Dani, a final-year Computer Science student at UBC. I recently completed a co-op in backend engineering, where I worked on systems supporting data pipelines and ingestion workflows using tools like Jenkins and cloud services in production environments.

I enjoy the nature of adapting quickly and tackling new project demands, whether that means learning a new tool, diving into unfamiliar systems, or solving problems end-to-end. Always open to exploring new technologies and improving how things work 🌱

Through my degree and work experience, I’ve enjoyed learning across different areas of software and adapting quickly to new project demands, whether that’s picking up a new tool, getting familiar with an unfamiliar system, or owning a problem end-to-end. I’m always looking to explore new technologies and improve how things work  🌱

Feel free to reach out, I'm happy to connect by [email](mailto:danirenn16@gmail.com)! 📧
