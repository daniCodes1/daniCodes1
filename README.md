### Welcome! 
I'm Dani, a fourth-year computer science student at UBC with 7 years of experience in diverse fields. Most recently, Iâ€™ve completed an internship focused on software development and data analysis, where I worked on building solutions that are both efficient and scalable.

Some things I have been working on:
  * a [personal website](https://daniCodes1.github.io), which will help you get to know me better :smiley:
  * an application that reads and analyzes forms for a company (Python OCR and JavaScript)
  * an [intelligent dashboard](https://github.com/daniCodes1/IntelligentDashboard) to support your daily tasks

Want to reach out? I'm available by [email](mailto:danirenn16@gmail.com)!
