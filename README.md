### Welcome! 
I’m Dani, a final-year Computer Science student at UBC. I recently completed a co-op in backend engineering, where I worked on systems supporting data pipelines and ingestion workflows using tools like Jenkins and cloud services in production environments.

Through my degree and work experience, I’ve enjoyed learning across different areas of software and adapting quickly to new project demands, whether that’s picking up a new tool, getting familiar with an unfamiliar system, or owning a problem end-to-end. I’m always looking to explore new technologies and improve how things work 💭

Feel free to reach out, I'm happy to connect by [email](mailto:danirenn16@gmail.com)! 📧
