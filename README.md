### Welcome! 
I'm Dani, a final-year Computer Science student at UBC and a software developer focused on building reliable, scalable systems. I’m currently working on backend engineering and data automation, supporting large-scale data pipelines, external and internal data ingestion and processing, and production workflows powered by Jenkins and cloud services.

I enjoy the nature of adapting quickly and tackling new project demands, whether that means learning a new tool, diving into unfamiliar systems, or solving problems end-to-end. Always open to exploring new technologies and improving how things work 🌱

Feel free to reach out by email, I'm happy to connect by [email](mailto:danirenn16@gmail.com)! 📧
